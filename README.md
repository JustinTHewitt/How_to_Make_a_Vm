# How to make a Vm/w Azure 

There are many ways to make a Virtural machine and many diffrent softwares we could use. I will be using Azure, Azure is a cloud computing and lets us do alot of things
some examples are: Makeing a Vm, Managing teams, File transfers, Running tasks, Computing backend calculations, and much more.
If you would like to know what a Virtual machine is [Google actual has a great article about it.](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjXuYHIkdmBAxUknokEHdAuCW0QFnoECBwQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fazure.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fresources%2Fcloud-computing-dictionary%2Fwhat-is-a-virtual-machine&usg=AOvVaw08SeczljyrIzAOlpuWZ-Lr&opi=89978449)

What you will need: A microsoft account and a Credit/Debit card. (if you are doing the free trail it will not charge unless you use 200 credits or 30 days has pass)

1. To get started We are going to go to Their main website.(https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)

2. After we had to their main website we will hit get started.

That will bring us to Pay as you go.

Pay as you go is quite forward, it means you will pay for as much as you use. Before you do anything it will let you know how much it would be by hour.
We do need to be careful when using as we could be charged when we are done with projects because we did not delete everything when we were done.
There is an option for a free trial that will give us 200 credits for 30 days so whichever comes first. 

3. Now we will hit get started, again.

9. When you are at the main page you can either select Virtual machines or type Vm/ VIrtual machines into the search bar.
   THere are other ways we could do this, like making a resource group before hand but I perfer it this way.
