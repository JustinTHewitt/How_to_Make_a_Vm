To get started We are going to go to Their main website.(https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)

Pay as you go is quite forward, it means you will pay for as much as you use. Before you do anything it will let you know how much it would be by hour.
We do need to be careful when using as we could be charged when we are done with projects because we did not delete everything when we were done.
There is an option for a free trial that will give us 200 credits for 30 days so whichever comes first.
